All statistics are updated using slack users.list api whenever I get the chance to.

Only non deleted non bot users with a set status, status emoji, pronoun, title and start date are filtered and chosen from which is the random user of the day.

Statistics can also be accessed by sending request to https://api.hackclub.alimad.co/api/stats and same for user (/api/random)
